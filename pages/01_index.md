<!--
I was also a French & Spanish teacher, and I had never written a single line of code yet. Happy days!
The work I'm going to present today was built in collaboration with my incredible colleague and mentor Loïc Frémont, who
unfortunately could not be here today but who's responsible for maintaining the Sylius Stack and most of the ideas and implementations I'm going to show you today.

Mainly working on the documentation.

*Loïc*

We will present what's under the hood of the Sylius stack and some DX improvements on the Grid package.

We'll use a demo project to illustrate the new way to configure grids.

And we'll introduce a huge improvement on the User Experience using Live components.
